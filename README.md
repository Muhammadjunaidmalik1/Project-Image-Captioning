# Project-Image-Captioning
In this project, I created a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.  After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, tested the network on novel images!

Combined CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.
